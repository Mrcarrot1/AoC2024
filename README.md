# AoC 2024 by Mrcarrot
This is a (probably bad) implementation of Advent of Code 2024 in Standard ML of New Jersey(SML/NJ).

## Running
I'm not sure why you would want to run this, but here's how:
* Install SML/NJ. Instructions should be available at [smlnj.org](smlnj.org).
* Navigate to the root of this Git repository.
* Open an SML/NJ interactive session(usually with the `smlnj` command).
* Run `CM.make "AoC2024.cm";`.
* For the Part 1 result, use `DayX.part1 "inputfile.txt"`.
* For the Part 2 result, use `DayX.part2 "inputfile.txt"`.
